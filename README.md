## GANs Project: Face Generation

* **`dlnd_face_generation_starter.ipynb`**
* **`README.md`**
* **`requirements.txt`**
* **`tests.py`**

### Instructions

Open the notebook file, `dlnd_face_generation_starter.ipynb` and follow the instructions. This project is organized as follows:

* **Data Pipeline**: implement a data augmentation function and a custom dataset class to load the images and transform them.
* **Model Implementation**: build a custom generator and a custom discriminator to make your GAN
* **Loss Functions and Gradient Penalty**: decide on loss functions and whether you want to use gradient penalty or not.
* **Training Loop**: implement the training loop and decide on which strategy to use
